<hr />
<p>Loss exceedance curves, also known as exceedance probability curves, are computed by a rank ordering a set of losses by period and computing the probability of exceedance for each level of loss based on relative frequency. Losses are first assigned to periods of time (typically years) by reference to the <strong>occurrence</strong> file which contains the event occurrences in each period over a timeline of, say, 10,000 periods. Event losses are summed within each period for an aggregate loss exceedance curve, or the maximum of the event losses in each period is taken for an occurrence loss exceedance curve. From this point, there are a few variants available as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wheatsheaf/multiple EP - losses by period are rank ordered for each sample, which produces many loss exceedance curves - one for each sample across the same timeline. The wheatsheaf shows the variation in return period loss due to sampled damage uncertainty, for a given timeline of occurrences.</p></li>
<li><p>Full uncertainty/single EP - all sampled losses by period are rank ordered to produce a single loss exceedance curve. This treats each sample as if it were another period of losses in an extrapolated timeline. Stacking the curves end-to-end rather then viewing side-by-side as in the wheatsheaf is a form of averaging with respect to a particular return period loss and provides stability in the point estimate, for a given timeline of occurrences.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample mean - the losses by period are first averaged across the samples, and then a single loss exceedance curve is created from the period sample mean losses.</p></li>
<li><p>Wheatsheaf mean - the loss exceedance curves from the Wheatsheaf are averaged across each return period, which produces a single loss exceedance curve.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ranked losses represent the first, second, third, etc.. largest loss periods within the total number of periods of say 10,000 years. The relative frequency of these periods of loss is interpreted as the probability of loss exceedance, that is to say that the top ranked loss has an exceedance probability of 1 in 10000, or 0.01%, the second largest loss has an exceedance probability of 0.02%, and so on. In the output file, the exceedance probability is expressed as a return period, which is the reciprocal of the exceedance probability multiplied by the total number of periods. Only non-zero loss periods are returned.</p>
<h5 id="parameters-1">Parameters</h5>
<ul>
<li>-K{sub-directory}. The subdirectory of /work containing the input summarycalc binary files.<br />
Then the following tuple of parameters must be specified for at least one analysis type;</li>
<li>Analysis type. Use -F for Full Uncertainty Aggregate, -f for Full Uncertainty Occurrence, -W for Wheatsheaf Aggregate, -w for Wheatsheaf Occurrence, -S for Sample Mean Aggregate, -s for Sample Mean Occurrence, -M for Mean of Wheatsheaf Aggregate, -m for Mean of Wheatsheaf Occurrence</li>
<li>Output filename</li>
</ul>
<p>An optional parameter is;</p>
<ul>
<li>-r. Use return period file - use this parameter if you are providing a file with a specific list of return periods. If this file is not present then all calculated return periods will be returned, for losses greater than zero.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="usage-1">Usage</h5>
<pre><code>$ leccalc [parameters] &gt; lec.csv
</code></pre>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<pre><code>&#39;First generate summarycalc binaries by running the core workflow, for the required summary set
$ eve 1 2 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -c - | summarycalc -g -1 - &gt; work/summary1/summarycalc1.bin
$ eve 2 2 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -c - | summarycalc -g -1 - &gt; work/summary1/summarycalc2.bin
&#39;Then run leccalc, pointing to the specified sub-directory of work containing summarycalc binaries.
$ leccalc -Ksummary1 -F lec_full_uncertainty_agg.csv -f lec_full_uncertainty_occ.csv 
&#39; With return period file
$  leccalc -r -Ksummary1 -F lec_full_uncertainty_agg.csv -f lec_full_uncertainty_occ.csv </code></pre>
<h5 id="internal-data-1">Internal data</h5>
<p>leccalc requires the occurrence.bin file</p>
<ul>
<li>static/occurrence.bin</li>
</ul>
<p>and will optionally use the following additional files if present</p>
<ul>
<li>input/returnperiods.bin</li>
<li>input/periods.bin</li>
</ul>
<p>leccalc does not have a standard input that can be streamed in. Instead, it reads in summarycalc binary data from a file in a fixed location. The format of the binaries must match summarycalc standard output. The location is in the 'work' subdirectory of the present working directory. For example;</p>
<ul>
<li>work/summarycalc1.bin</li>
<li>work/summarycalc2.bin</li>
<li>work/summarycalc3.bin</li>
</ul>
<p>The user must ensure the work subdirectory exists. The user may also specify a subdirectory of /work to store these files. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>work/summaryset1/summarycalc1.bin</li>
<li>work/summaryset1/summarycalc2.bin</li>
<li>work/summaryset1/summarycalc3.bin</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for leccalc not having an input stream is that the calculation is not valid on a subset of events, i.e. within a single process when the calculation has been distributed across multiple processes. It must bring together all event losses before assigning event losses to periods and ranking losses by period. The summarycalc losses for all events (all processes) must be written to the /work folder before running leccalc.</p>
<h5 id="calculation-1">Calculation</h5>
<p>All files with extension .bin from the specified subdirectory are read into memory, as well as the occurrence.bin. The summarycalc losses are grouped together and sampled losses are assigned to period according to which period the events occur in.</p>
<p>If multiple events occur within a period;</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>aggregate</strong> loss exceedance curves, the sum of losses is calculated.</li>
<li>For <strong>occurrence</strong> loss exceedance curves, the maximum loss is calculated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the calculation differs by lec type, as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Full uncertainty - all losses by period are rank ordered to produce a single loss exceedance curve.</li>
<li>Wheatsheaf - losses by period are rank ordered for each sample, which produces many loss exceedance curves - one for each sample across the same timeline.</li>
<li>Sample mean - the losses by period are first averaged across the samples, and then a single loss exceedance curve is created from the period sample mean losses.</li>
<li>Wheatsheaf mean - the return period losses from the Wheatsheaf are averaged, which produces a single loss exceedance curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all curves, the analytical mean loss (sidx = -1) is output as a separate exceedance probability curve. If the calculation is run with 0 samples, then leccalc will still return the analytical mean loss exceedance curve. The 'type' field in the output identifies the type of loss exceedance curve, which is 1 for analytical mean, and 2 for curves calculated from the samples.</p>

<h5 id="period-weightings">Period weightings</h5>
<p>An additional feature of leccalc is available to vary the relative importance of the period losses by providing a period weightings file to the calculation. In this file, a weight can be assigned to each period make it more or less important than neutral weighting (1 divided by the total number of periods). For example, if the neutral weight for period 1 is 1 in 10000 years, or 0.0001, then doubling the weighting to 0.0002 will mean that period's loss reoccurrence rate would double. Assuming no other period losses, the return period of the loss of period 1 in this example would be halved.</p>
<p>All period_nos must appear in the file from 1 to P (no gaps). There is no constraint on the sum of weights. Periods with zero weight will not contribute any losses to the loss exceedance curve.</p>
<p>This feature will be invoked automatically if the periods.bin file is present in the input directory.</p>
