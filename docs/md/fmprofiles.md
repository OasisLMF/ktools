The fields with an x are those which are required by the profile. The full names of the fields are as follows;

|     sc1    |     scale_1         |
|     sc2    |     scale_2         |

An allocation rule can be assigned to each call of fmcalc, which determines whether calculated losses should be back-allocated to the contributing items, and if so how. This is specified via the command line parameter -a. 

The choices are as follows;

| Allocrule description                                                        | allocrule_id|
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Don't back-allocate losses (default if no parameter supplied)                | 0           |
| Back allocate losses to items in proportion to input loss                    | 1           |
| Back-allocate losses to items in proportion to prior level loss              | 2           |
| Back-allocate losses to items in proportion to prior level loss (reinsurance)| 3           |

## Effective deductibles

Often there are more than one hierarchal levels with deductibles, and there is a choice of methods of accumulation of deductibles through the hierarchy. Whenever a rule with a deductible is used in the loss calculation then it is accumulated through the calculation in an **effective_deductible** variable. The effective deductible is the smaller of the deductible amount and the loss. 

All deductibles amounts calculated from the deductible_1 field are simply additive through the hierarchy.

Ay any level, the user can specify a calcrule using a minimum and/or maximum deductible which changes the way that effective deductibles are accumulated. 

For a minimum deductible specified in calcrules using the deductible_2 field, the calculation increases the effective_deductible carried forward from the previous levels up to the minimum deductible if it is smaller. 

For a maximum deductible specified in calcrules using the deductible_3 field, the calculation decreases the effective_deductible carried forward from the previous levels down to the maximum deductible if it is larger.

## Adjustment of loss for prior level limits 

Loss adjustments due to minimum and maximum deductibles may lead to breaching or falling short of prior level limits. For instance, an increase in loss due a policy maximum deductible being applied can lead to a breach of site limit that applied at the prior calculation level. Conversely, a decrease in loss due to policy minimum deductible can leave the loss falling short of a site limit applied at the prior calculation level. In these situations the prior level limits are carried through and reapplied in all calcrules that have minimum and/or maximum deductibles. 

We introduce the following variables;

* **over limit** is the sum of the amount by which limits are exceeded at the prior level calculation (positive measure)
* **under limit** is the sum of the amount by which losses fall short of limits at the prior level calculation (positive measure)
* **loss delta** is the amount by which the loss would change due to the enforcement of a minimum or maximum ignoring prior level limits (positive for loss increase and negative for loss decrease). The loss is adjusted by an amount up to the loss delta depending on the values carried in the under and over limit variables

### Scenarios for under and over limit

The over and under limit variables are initialised when there exist prior level limits. The possible cases are;

| Case | Under limit | Over limit  | Meaning                                                          |
|:-----|-------------|-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1  |  0          |     0       | All prior level losses are exactly at their limits			      |
|   2  |  0          |     >0      | Some prior level losses are over limit and none are under limit  |
|   3  |  >0         |     0       | Some prior level losses are under limit and none are over limit  |
|   4  |  >0         |     >0      | Some prior level losses are over limit and some are under limit  |

When the loss delta is positive; 

* in cases 1 and 2 the loss is not adjusted upwards because the prior level losses are already at their limits. The loss delta is added to the carried over limit.
* in cases 3 and 4 the loss is adjusted upwards to a maximum of the under limit. Losses are therefore adjusted up to the prior level limits and any excess loss delta is added to the over limit variable. The loss increase is subtracted from the carried under limit.

When the loss delta is negative; 

* in cases 1 and 2 the loss delta is added to the over limit until the over limit is zero and any excess loss delta is used to adjust the loss downwards. Losses that are over limit by more than the loss delta remain at their limits, and decrease only if the over limit is fully eroded by the loss delta.
* in cases 3 and 4 losses are adjusted down fully by the loss delta, or to zero if the loss delta is greater than the initial loss. The loss adjustment is added to the carried under limit.

Current calculation level limits may also apply and these are used to update the over limit and under limit measures to carry through to the next level.

## Calcrules

In the following notation;
* x.loss is the input loss to the calculation
* x.effective_deductible is the input effective deductible to the calculation (where required)
* loss is the calculated loss
